  Analyze the following user message to determine if they want to end or exit the conversation.

  User message: "{user_input}"

  Consider these indicators of wanting to exit:
  - Direct commands like "quit", "exit", "bye"
  - Expressions of completion like "that's all", "I'm done"
  - Polite endings with thanks
  - Satisfaction indicators like "perfect, thanks"
  - Time-related endings like "I have to go"
  
  Respond with only "YES" if the user wants to exit, or "NO" if they want to continue the conversation.
